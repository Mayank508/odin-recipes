    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        The double fry method is key to achieving the super crispy, thin crust without overcooking the interior of the ball.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>canola oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup rice flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan with enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high; cover, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and run under cold water until cool enough to handle. Drain well and pat dry.</li>
        <li>While potatoes cook, heat 3 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-low to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Using a ricer or potato masher, thoroughly mash potatoes so no chunks remain. Stir together mashed potatoes, rice flour, cornstarch, kosher salt, and seasoning salt in a medium bowl until mixture comes together and forms a dough, adding 1 teaspoon of water at a time as needed.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 4 pieces. Shape each piece into a 1-inch diameter log, and cut each log into 1-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry dough pieces in hot oil until lightly golden, turning occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spider or slotted spatula, transfer from oil to a wire rack set over a baking sheet to drain. Repeat with remaining dough pieces.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high to increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry a second time, in batches, until deep golden brown and crispy, another 2 minutes. Return to wire rack and dust with additional seasoning salt, if desired. Serve immediately</li>            
    </ol>
